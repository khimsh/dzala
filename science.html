              In very challenging time of Covid-19 Pandemic, as quick response, work on novel composition for prevention of microbial
              infections (Viral, bacterial or fungal) was reinforced and as result novel Glycine & Hydrogen Peroxide Antimicrobial Solution

                Prevention/ Prophylaxis of Viral, Bacterial or Fungal Infections
              </h3>

              <p>
                Presently, there is an immense demand to prevent spreading of microbial, especially viral infections in the population.
                Classical ways of the prevention are treatment of surfaces with antiseptic solutions, facial masks or vaccination. GlyPerATM
                -the composition comprising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in combination with glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid or glycine that allow
                using former as antimicrobial, antiviral agent, while latter substances should neutralize the toxic effects of H2O2 on the
                cell and tissues. The compositions can be used for gargling of mouth or as a spray in the nasal cavity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, is an established antiseptic that destroys bacteria, viruses and fungi. It is used: for
                disinfection of material surfaces (e.g. of medical instruments or devices)for sterilization of water and raw materials for
                food production (e.g. dairy products) as antimicrobial agent for vegetable/fruit skin treatment for disinfection of wounds
              </p>

              <p>
                Although H2O2 is a GRAS (Generally regarded as safe) substance, amounts used for the applications mentioned above are
                strictly regulated because: H2O2 is a very strong oxidant and damages the cell! H2O2 is a member of chemically aggressive
                ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) and its main target is mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. Thus, usage of H2O2 in
                medical care as an antimicrobial agent for treatment of oral/nasal or tympanic (middle ear) cavities are restricted.
              </p>

              <p>
                The cell has an elaborate defense system against the oxidative stress. Reduced glutathione (GSH; Tripeptide:
                g-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) is one of the most important scavengers of ROS. Namely, within the cell, reduced GSH
                inactivates hydrogen peroxide. We very recently have discovered that glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid or the amino acid glycine
                can increase amounts of reduced GSH many fold and this way neutralize toxic effects of H2O2 within the cell.*
              </p>

              <p>
                Based on our knowledge, we are providing novel composition, called GlyPerATM that leave antimicrobial and activities of H2O2
                intact, but can be used to protect a cell, tissues, organs or a multi-cellular organism, such as animals and humans, against
                hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress. How it works? We know that H2O2 outside of cells kills bacteria and viruses.
                Within the cell, however, it damages mitochondria and also interferes with other physiological processes. In the presence of
                glycine, for instance, reduced GSH within the cell is elevated and this neutralizes toxic effects of H2O2. Thus, action of
                H2O2 on bacteria and viruses outside of cells remains unimpaired.
